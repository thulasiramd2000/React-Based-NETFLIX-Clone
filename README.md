The stack that is being used: React (custom hooks, context, portals), Firebase (Firestore/auth), Compound & Styled components!

Hey! I finally finished this Netflix clone (took me more time than I expected ðŸ˜…). My idea was to make everything static (movies, series, tv shows, ...) but then I found this really cool TMDB API which you can pull most popular movies, top rated shows, what's trending, collections, lists and muuuch more. Really worth checking the effort made.

First use the <b>Firebase App</b> api key of your's as the project's api keys has been removed and you can add them in /lib/firebase.prod.js file and <b>tmdb</b> api key also needs to be changed, which is present in request.js file under the project directory.
